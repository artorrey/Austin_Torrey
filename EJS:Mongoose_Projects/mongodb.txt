In the shell, create a database called “mydatabase”.

    use mydatabase

Create a collection called “coffee”.

    db.coffee

Within coffee, create an object that has name: "frappuccino" and size: "grande".

    db.coffee.insert({name: 'frappuccino', size: 'grande'})

Create another object that has name: “espresso” and size: “tall”.

    db.coffee.insert({name: 'espresso', size: 'tall'})

Create one more object that has name: “earl grey” and size: “grande”.

    db.coffee.insert({name: 'earl grey', size: 'grande'})

Now, select earl grey and update it to have another key value pair: temp: “hot”.

    db.coffee.update({name: 'earl grey'}, {$set: {temp: 'hot'}})

Let’s also update espresso to have the name “White Chocolate Mocha” instead.

    db.coffee.update({name: 'espresso'}, {$set: {name: 'White Chocolate Mocha'}})
    
Let’s do a search. How do we find all drinks that have a size of grande?

    db.coffee.find({size: 'grande'})
    
How do we delete an object from our collection?

    db.coffee.remove({name: 'earl grey'})

How do we delete the coffee collection?

    db.coffee.drop()

How do we delete the mydatabase database?

    db.dropDatabase()
